# Introduction

Vital's lab test API allows digital health companies to carry out at-home lab testing.
Companies can use the API to order a variety of tests, using various sampling methods.

We partner with a number of CLIA and CAP certified labs across the United States that give us coverage of a
variety of diagnostic tests such as lipids panels, metabolic profiles and hormone tests.
These test samples can be collected via, dried bloodspot, saliva or phlebotomy.
