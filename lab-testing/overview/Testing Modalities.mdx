# Testing Modalities

Three types are currently supported:

- At home test kit
- At home phlebotomy visit
- In lab phlebotomy visit

### At-home test kits

This involves sending a kit to a patients home that allows the patient to collect their
sample specimen and send back to our lab networks in the mail.

At home testing kits are comprised of a number of components such as:

### In lab phlebotomy

In lab draws involve the patient going to a lab location either Quest or Labcorp, to carry out the test.
To carry out this test you need a requisition form. Vital's API can generate this for you, if the patient mets certain conditions. Results are then retrieved via Vital's API.

### At-home phlebotomy

At-home phlebotomy requires mobile phlebotmists visiting a patient at their home and carrying out the phlebotomy draw. The sample is then delivered to the lab by the phlebotomist.
