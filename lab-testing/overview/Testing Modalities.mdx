# Testing Modalities

Three types are currently supported:

- At home test kit
- At home phlebotomy visit
- In lab phlebotmy visit

### At-home test kits

This involves sending a kit to a patients home that allows the patient to collect their
sample specimen and send back to our lab networks in the mail.

At home testing kits are kits are typically comprised of a number of
components such as:

### In lab phlebotomy

In lab draws involve the patient going to a lab location either Quest or Labcorp, to carry out the test.
The requisition forms required to carry out this test can be generated using Vital's API, once a patient has
met certain conditions. Results can then be retrieved through Vital's API.

### At-home phlebotomy

At-home phlebotomy involves mobile phlebotmists visiting a patient at their home and carrying out the phlebotomy draw.
The sample is then delivered directly to the lab by the phlebotomist.
