# Introduction

To get started with Vital you will need `API Keys`, which you can request by registering with us in the [dashboard](https://app.tryvital.io). Once registered, we will place you onto our waitlist for further review. Once you have been approved, you will be granted access to: the [dashboard](https://app.tryvital.io), our sandbox and production environments and be given `API Keys` for each environment.

| Keys                  |
| --------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| @@FiKey client_id     | Private identifier for your team |
| @@FiKey client_secret | Private key                      |

Your environment can be used to set private identifier for your team.
