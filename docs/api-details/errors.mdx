### Error Schema

We use HTTP status codes to signify if a request was successful or not.

<ResponseField name="error_type" type="string">
  A taxanomy of the error. This is used to group errors together. This is safe
  for programmatic use.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="error_message" type="string">
  A human-readable representation of the error. This is not intended to be
  static, and may change at any time.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="error_code" type="integer">
  A HTTP status code. This code is intended to be used by the client for
  programmatic processing of errors.
</ResponseField>
