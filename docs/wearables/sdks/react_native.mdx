## 1. Introduction

You can install the Core and HealthKit SDK by using npm:

```js
npm install vital-core-react-native
npm install vital-health-react-native
```

You start by setting up the Core SDK:

```js
import { VitalCore } from "vital-core-react-native";

VitalCore.configure(
  VITAL_ENVIRONMENT,
  VITAL_API_KEY,
  VITAL_REGION,
  logsEnabled
);
```

Be sure to do the configuration, before setting up the `userId`:

```js
import { VitalCore } from "vital-core-react-native";

VitalCore.setUserId(userId);
```

The Core SDK is now ready to use. You can now set up the HealthKit SDK.

You start by enabling HealthKit capabilities in your app. Please follow this [guide](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/healthkit/setting_up_healthkit). It should looks like this:

Don't forget to add the `NSHealthShareUsageDescription` keys to your `Info.plist` file. Finally setting up the HealthKit SDK is just:

```js
import { VitalHealth } from "vital-health-react-native";

VitalHealth.configure(automaticConfiguration, numberOfDaysToPull, logsEnabled);
```

If you set `automaticConfiguration` to true, the SDK will do everything on your behalf.

Before syncing data, you need to ask for permissions to the user. You do it by calling:

```js
import { VitalHealth, VitalResource } from "vital-health-react-native";

VitalHealth.askForResources([VitalResource.Steps]);
```

Finally, if you are logging out the user, please make sure you call:

```js
import { VitalHealth } from "vital-health-react-native";

VitalHealth.cleanUp();
```
