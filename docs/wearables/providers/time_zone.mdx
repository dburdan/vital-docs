title: "Time zone awareness"

Vital works with varying levels of time zone awareness across all supported providers. The following section describes the levels and how Vital works with the data in that regard.

## Levels of Awareness

### Cloud-based providers

| Level                      | Remarks                                                                              |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| At Source                  | <p>Each data sample or daily summary is individually tagged with the time zone in which it was captured.</p> |
| Inferred TZ _or_ Absent      | <p>Vital tries to infer the time zone from any available geographical data. If the inferrence has failed, the data would not be tagged with any time zone.</p> |
| Provider User TZ           | <p>The provider does not track time zone information on individual data samples, but do keep track of at least the latest time zone of a user.</p><p>Vital pulls and interprets data with respect to the latest user time zone as reported by the provider.</p> |
| User Fallback TZ _or_ UTC    | <p>The provider is completely time zone unaware.</p><p>Vital uses either the user's Vital [Fallback Time Zone](#fallback-time-zone) (if specified) or UTC to **both** pull and tag the data.</p> |
| User Fallback TZ _or_ Absent | <p>The provider is completely time zone unaware.</p><p>Vital uses either the user's Vital [Fallback Time Zone](#fallback-time-zone) (if specified) or UTC to pull the data. </p> The data would not be tagged with any time zone, except when it is pulled using the user's [Fallback Time Zone](#fallback-time-zone). |
| Absent                     | <p>Vital pulls data using UTC as the reference time zone. However, the data would not be tagged with any time zone.</p> |

### SDK providers

| Level                  | Remarks                                                                                    |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Device TZ at Sync      | <p>Vital SDK tags all outstanding data with the current device time zone at synchronization time.</p> |

## User Fallback Time Zone

Some providers neither expose nor even capture time zone information at source. So Vital can only request data and interpret them strictly in UTC.

If you prefer the data to be contextualize to the geographical location of a user, a Fallback Time Zone (denoted by an [IANA tz database identifier](https://data.iana.org/time-zones/tz-link.html))
can be specified on a per-user basis. Once specified, Vital would use the time zone to pull data and interpret timestamps from any time zone unware providers from that point onwards. 

You can specify the Fallback Time Zone when:

* [Creating a new user](/api-reference/user/create-user); or
* [Patching an existing user](/api-reference/user/patch-user)

You will also get information about the source (by slug) and the last updated time of the Fallback Time Zone [when getting an existing user](/api-reference/user/get-user). Fallback Time Zone manually supplied via the REST API would always have a source slug of `manual`.
