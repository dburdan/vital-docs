## Webhooks

On successful connection, you will receive:

- [Connection create](/webhooks/data_flow#connection-created) wehbook.
- [Historical Meals](/webhooks/data_flow#historical-data-flow) webhook, implying that the last _2 weeks_ of data are fetched successfully.
- [Daily webhooks](/webhooks/data_flow#daily-data-flow) `data.daily.meal.created` and `data.daily.meal.updated` are issued, as new or more up-to-date data becomes available.
