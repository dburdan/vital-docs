## Enabling Dexcom Share

You can follow the guides by [Dexcom](https://www.dexcom.com/faqs/how-do-i-share-my-dexcom-g6-glucose-data-followers) on how to enable sharing for your device. Ensure you use the application for your device and not Dexcom Clarity.

## Vital Widget

To connect your device with the *widget*, follow the link wizard ensuring and enter your username and password.

## Vital Link

You can also connect a Dexcom user to vital using vital client. For additional information please consult the API reference.

<SnippetGroup>
```python
link_token = client.Link.create(user_id)
client.Link.password_provider(link_token, "dexcom", username, password)
```

```js
const { link_token } = await client.Link.create(user_id);
await client.Link.password_provider(link_token, "dexcom", username, password);
```

## Webhooks

On successful connection, you will recieve a `provider.connection.created` wehbook. As is with most parts of Vital, webhooks for `data.daily.glucose.created`, `data.daily.glucose.updated`, are available sent to your team's servers when new data is available during the day.

For this provider however, Vital will begin to aggregate the data for the last 24 hours and will not go beyond that. As a result, there will be no `historical.glucose.created` sent out. If you would like to pull the data immediately after connection, you can use the `user/refresh` endpoint.
