## Enabling Dexcom Share

You can follow the guides by [Dexcom](https://www.dexcom.com/faqs/how-do-i-share-my-dexcom-g6-glucose-data-followers) on how to enable sharing for your device. Ensure you use the application for your device and not Dexcom Clarity.

## Vital Widget

To connect your device with the *widget*, follow the link wizard ensuring and enter your username and password.

## Vital Link

You can also connect a Dexcom user to vital using vital client. For additional information please consult the API reference.

<CodeGroup>

client.Link.password_provider(
    link_token, "dexcom", username, password
)
```

## Webhooks

On successful connection, you will recieve a [Connection create](/webhooks/data_flow#connection-created) wehbook. [Daily webhooks](/webhooks/data_flow#daily-data-flow) `data.daily.glucose.created` and `data.daily.glucose.updated` will also be issued to your team as new or more up-to-date data becomes available during the day.

For this provider however, Vital will begin to aggregate the data for the last 24 hours and will not go beyond that. As a result, there will be no [Historical webhooks](/webhooks/data_flow#historical-data-flow) issued. If you would like to pull the data immediately after connection, you can use the `user/refresh` endpoint.
