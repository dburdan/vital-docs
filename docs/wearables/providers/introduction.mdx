## Data Frequency

This section describes how we fetch data from the different providers. For all of them, we send you webhook updates when new data is available. The difference is how frequently we fetch data.

Whenever possible, we set up our integrations so that we are immediately notified when new data is available. These are the providers marked as `Webhook` in the table below. For these providers, we fetch the latest data as soon as it is available and we send a webhook update.

For the other providers, marked as `Polling` below, we periodically fetch the latest data every 10-15 minutes. If you want more granular control over this, you can use the [refresh endpoint](/api-reference/user#refresh-users-data) to fetch the latest data immediately.

All data can be fetched instantaneously, some are configured via our live refresh endpoint and others are automatically kept up to date via our webhook implementation.

## Historical Days Retrieved

When a new provider is connected to a user, Vital retrieves the historical data for this user from the connected provider. The following number of historical days of data are retrieved for each provider:

<Info>

To provide you with the best possible experience, for some providers we implement a mix of Webhook and Polling for different resources. Check out the [resources page](https://docs.tryvital.io/wearables/providers/Resources) for more info.

## Time Zone Awareness

Vital considers a provider to be **time zone aware** when one of the following applies:

* the provider has already normalized data in floating time (e.g., certain Fitbit datasets);
* individual data points from the provider have time zone attributions, in addition to timestamps being on a fixed time basis (generally UTC); or
* the provider tracks the time zone of the user, and can be exposed to Vital.

For time zone **unaware** providers, Vital has to always assume UTC clock, unless a [Fallback Time Zone](#fallback-time-zone) is specified for the user.

The following list describes the state of time zone awareness of all supported provider integrations.

| Provider                                                                     | Slug                   | Time Zone Awareness |

### Fallback Time Zone

Some providers neither expose nor even capture time zone information at source. So Vital can only request data and interpret them strictly in UTC.

If you prefer the data to be contextualize to the geographical location of a user, a Fallback Time Zone (denoted by an [IANA tz database identifier](https://data.iana.org/time-zones/tz-link.html))
can be specified on a per-user basis. Once specified, Vital would use the time zone to pull data and interpret timestamps from any time zone unware providers from that point onwards. 

You can specify the Fallback Time Zone when:

* [Creating a new user](/api-reference/user/create-user); or
* [Patching an existing user](/api-reference/user/patch-user)

You will also get information about the source (by slug) and the last updated time of the Fallback Time Zone [when getting an existing user](/api-reference/user/get-user).
