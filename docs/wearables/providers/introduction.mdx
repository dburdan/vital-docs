## Data Frequency

This section describes how we fetch data from the different providers. For all of them, we send you webhook updates when new data is available. The difference is how frequently we fetch data.

Whenever possible, we set up our integrations so that we are immediately notified when new data is available. These are the providers marked as `Webhook` in the table below. For these providers, we fetch the latest data as soon as it is available and we send a webhook update.

For the other providers, marked as `Polling` below, we periodically fetch the latest data every 10-15 minutes. If you want more granular control over this, you can use the [refresh endpoint](/api-reference/user#refresh-users-data) to fetch the latest data immediately.

All data can be fetched instantaneously, some are configured via our live refresh endpoint and others are automatically kept up to date via our webhook implementation.

## Historical Days Retrieved

## Time Zone Awareness

Vital works with varying levels of time zone awareness across all supported providers. The following section describes the levels and how Vital works with the data in that regard.

### Levels of Awareness

##### Cloud-based providers

| Level                    | Remarks                                                                              |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| At Source                | <p>Each data sample or daily summary is individually tagged with the time zone in which it was captured.</p> |
| Provider User TZ         | <p>The provider reports the time zone on a per-user basis, despite individual data samples being time zone unaware.</p><p>Vital pulls and interprets data with respect to the latest user time zone as reported by the provider.</p> |
| Vital Fallback TZ or UTC | <p>The provider is completely time zone unaware.</p><p>Vital uses UTC as the time zone basis to pull and tag data, unless a Vital [Fallback Time Zone](#fallback-time-zone) is specified for the Vital user.</p> |
| UTC only                 | <p>Vital uses UTC as the time zone basis to pull and tag data.</p> |

##### SDK providers

| Level                  | Remarks                                                                                    |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Device TZ at Sync      | <p>Vital SDK tags all outstanding data with the current device time zone at synchronization time.</p> |


### State of integrations

The following list describes the level of time zone awareness of all supported provider integrations.

### Fallback Time Zone

Some providers neither expose nor even capture time zone information at source. So Vital can only request data and interpret them strictly in UTC.

If you prefer the data to be contextualize to the geographical location of a user, a Fallback Time Zone (denoted by an [IANA tz database identifier](https://data.iana.org/time-zones/tz-link.html))
can be specified on a per-user basis. Once specified, Vital would use the time zone to pull data and interpret timestamps from any time zone unware providers from that point onwards. 

You can specify the Fallback Time Zone when:

* [Creating a new user](/api-reference/user/create-user); or
* [Patching an existing user](/api-reference/user/patch-user)

You will also get information about the source (by slug) and the last updated time of the Fallback Time Zone [when getting an existing user](/api-reference/user/get-user). Fallback Time Zone manually supplied via the REST API would always have a source slug of `manual`.
