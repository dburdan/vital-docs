The Vital iOS app allows your customers to quickly sync their Apple HealthKit data with you. This is quite handy if you don't have an iOS app, but you still want to analyse the data stored in the Apple Health app.

## How does it work?

The flow is quite straighforward:

1. Your user, is already part of our system (e.g. they have a `userId`). If they aren't, you can create one by using our [Create User](/api-reference/user/create-user) endpoint.
2. You create a code, against a `userId`. You can use our [Create Code](/api-reference/link/create-code) endpoint for this.
3. You provide this code to your user. They will then go to the Settings and input this code. Once succesfully, their data will be synced.
