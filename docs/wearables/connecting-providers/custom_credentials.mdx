title: "Custom Authentication"
---

With Vital we give you the ability to customize the OAuth credentials screen for various providers.
This provides a more cohesive experience for your users as it gives a truly whitelabelled experience for your application/mobile application.

Typically when you don't use custom credentials your oauth screen will look like this and used our shared credentials:

![Default Credentials](/img/default_credentials.png)

With custom credentials you can use your own team name and setup your own logo for the provider.

## How to setup custom credentials

To setup custom credentials you need to do the following:

1. Generate Client Credentials for your custom accounts, you can do this by going to the providers developer accounts page and creating a new application.
2. Email Support@tryvital.io or message us on Slack with the following information:
   - The provider you want to customize
   - The client id and client secret for the provider
   - The redirect url for the provider
   - The name of your team
   - The logo for your team
3. We will then setup the custom credentials for you and let you know when it's ready to go.
