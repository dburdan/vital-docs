You can debug webhook events in one of two ways: the Dashboard or using the Svix API.

### [Vital Dashboard](https://app.tryvital.io)

The Vital [Dashboard](https://app.tryvital.io)
has a Webhooks section that allows you to test and observe webhook events.

### [Svix API](https://api.svix.com/docs)

Vital uses [Svix](https://www.svix.com) to send webhook events to your server. Svix offers the ability for you
to debug webhook events programmatically. In particular, the Svix [`List Messages`](https://api.svix.com/docs#operation/list_messages_api_v1_app__app_id__msg__get)
endpoint allows you to retrieve all the Webhook events for your app. From there, you can use the [`Get Message`](https://api.svix.com/docs#operation/get_message_api_v1_app__app_id__msg__msg_id___get)
endpoint to debug the contents of a webhook event.

From each of the above you can get more details about the webhook event:

```json
{
  "type": "message.attempt.failing",
  "data": {
    "appId": "app_2...WWfEZ",
    "appUid": "55c...c74d",
    "msgId": "msg_2L...AQLd",
    "endpointId": "ep_26...352",
    "lastAttempt": {
      "id": "atmpt_28L...7e0",
      "responseStatusCode": 404,
      "timestamp": "2022-04-26T17:56:30.991139+00:00"
    }
  }
}
```
