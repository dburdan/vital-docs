title: "Event Structure"
---

All our webhook events have the following standard structure:

* A top-level `event_type` field, specifying the payload type contained in the `data` field.
* A top-level `data` field containing the event-specific payload.

Schemas and examples are available through the Event Catalog tab in the Webhooks section of our Web portal.

```json Webhook Event
{
  "event_type": "daily.data.glucose.created",
  "data": {
    # ... event specific data
  }
}
```

## Wearable data events

Wearable data events have the following extended standard structure:

* An event type field for differentiating the payload contained in the data field. (JSON path: `$.event_type`)
* A data field, which comprises of:
   * The UUID of the Vital user for which this event is intended — note that this is not the `client_user_id` of the Vital user. (JSON path: `$.data.user_id`)
   * The metadata about the data source of this event (JSON path: `$.data.source`)
      * `name`: The human-readable name of the source
      * `slug`: The stable identifier Vital assigned to the source — see [Supported providers](/wearables/providers/introduction) for the complete list.
      * `logo`: The URL to an icon representing the source.
   * Any number of event-specific fields.


```json Wearable data events
{
  "event_type": "daily.data.glucose.created",
  "data": {
    "user_id": "5148a047-c8fc-438c-8edc-3e0f68a58df1",
    "source": {
      "name": "Fitbit",
      "slug": "fitbit",
      "logo": "https://path/to/example",
    },
    # ... event specific fields
  }
}
```

### Summary types

Each time a [summary object](/wearables/providers/resources) is created or updated, Vital emits a data event for the occurrence.
The object is made available directly at the top-level `data` field (JSON path: `$.data`), alongside the standard fields listed above.

```json An example Activity event
{
  "event_type": "daily.data.activity.created",
  "data": {
    "user_id": "5148a047-c8fc-438c-8edc-3e0f68a58df1",
    "source": {
      "name": "Fitbit",
      "slug": "fitbit",
      "logo": "https://path/to/example",
    },

    "calendar_date": "2023-05-17",
    "calories_active": ...,
    "calories_total": ...,
    "steps": ...,
    "distance": ...,
    # ... other activity summary fields
  }
}
```

### Timeseries types (except for Workout Streams)

Each time a batch of [timeseries samples](/wearables/providers/resources) has been created or updated, Vital emits a data event for the batch of samples.
The samples are made available under an inner `data` field under the top-level `data` field (JSON path: `$.data.data`).

```json An example Steps event
{
  "event_type": "daily.data.steps.created",
  "data": {
    "user_id": "5148a047-c8fc-438c-8edc-3e0f68a58df1",
    "source": {
      "name": "Fitbit",
      "slug": "fitbit",
      "logo": "https://path/to/example",
    },

    "data": [
      {
        "timestamp": "2023-05-16T10:00:00+00:00",
        "timezone_offset": 3600,
        "value": 237,
        "type": "automatic",
        "unit": "count"
      },
      {
        "timestamp": "2023-05-16T11:00:00+00:00",
        "timezone_offset": 3600,
        "value": 451,
        "type": "automatic",
        "unit": "count"
      },
      # ... other step samples in the batch
    ]
  }
}
```

### Workout Streams

While Workout Streams are classified as a timeseries type, it contains a huge amount of timeseries data
which cannot be delivered by our webhook message transport.

So events for Webhook Streams are shallow, with only some minimal metadata about the workout. Successful
reception of the event indicates that the data are available to be read via our REST API,
e.g., [the Workout Stream endpoint](/api-reference/workouts/get-stream) `GET /v2/timeseries/workouts/{workout_id}/stream`.

```json Workout Stream Created
{
  "event_type": "daily.data.workout_stream.created",
  "data": {
    "user_id": "5148a047-c8fc-438c-8edc-3e0f68a58df1",
    "source": {
      "name": "Fitbit",
      "slug": "fitbit",
      "logo": "https://path/to/example",
    },

    "message": "A developer-facing message",
    "workout_id": "d70009af-c84c-4f83-a400-334142f58a61",
    "provider_id": "8497e00c",
    "sport": {
      "id": 1,
      "name": "Sport",
      "slug": "sport"
    }
  }
}
```
