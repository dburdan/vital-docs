# Introduction

Let's get started, first youâ€™ll need API keys, which you can request by registering with us in the [Dashboard](https://app.tryvital.io).

Once registered, you will be granted access to: the [Dashboard](https://app.tryvital.io),
our Sandbox and Production environments, and be given a unique API key for each environment.

| Keys            |
| --------------- | -------------------------------- |
| @@FiKey api_key | Private identifier for your team |

| Environment        |                                             |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------- |
| @@FiBox sandbox    | Integration Testing                         |
| @@FiZap production | Live environment to use with real customers |

## Quickstart Setup

We offer different SDKs so you can start building your app right away.

## Creating Your First User

Once you have your API Keys you are ready to create your first user!

Almost all API requests will interact with a _user_. To allow a _user_ to connect to the API, first create a `user_id` using the `/user/` endpoint. A `user_id` is the unique key we use to lookup users in our database. This should be a unique ID generated from your application - upon user sign up.

:::caution
Personally identifiable information (PII), such as an email address or phone number, should not be used as input for the `user_id` parameter.
:::

<br />
<br />

<Swagger endpoint={"/user/"} method={"post"} title={"Create a Vital User"}>

```bash
curl --request POST \
     --url https://example.com/v2/user/ \
     --header 'Accept: application/json' \
     --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
     --data '
{
     "client_user_id": "string",
     "team_id": "3fa85f64-5717-4562-b3fc-2c963f66afa6",
     "id": "string"
}
'
```

```js
const { VitalClient } = require("Vital");

const client = new VitalClient({
  api_key: <API_KEY>,
  environment: "sandbox",
});

const user = await client.User.create(client_user_id)

```

```python
from vital import Client

client = Client(api_key=<API_KEY>, environment='sandbox')

user = client.User.create(client_user_id)
```

</Swagger>

## How it works

As you might have noticed, you use both a server and a client-side component to access Vital APIs. The flow looks like this:

The Vital flow begins when your user wants to connect their device to your application.

<HStack alignItems={"flex-start"} height={"900px"} overflow={"hidden"}>
  <VStack
    style={{
      height: "100%",
    }}
    width={"50%"}
  >
    <OrderedList height={"100%"}>
      <ListItem height={"29%"} mt={"200px"}>
        To launch Vital link, first generate a `link_token` by passing the
        `user_id` to the `/link/token` endpoint.
      </ListItem>
      <ListItem height={"33%"}>
        Pass the `link_token` into the Vital link component to open the link for
        the user. Please note: the `link_token` is a short-lived one-time use
        token.
      </ListItem>
      <ListItem>
        Use the onSuccess, onError, onExit callbacks to handle different events
        on your frontend.
      </ListItem>
    </OrderedList>
  </VStack>
  <VStack>
    <Image src="https://storage.googleapis.com/vital-assets/link-flow-explainer.png" />
  </VStack>
</HStack>

<br />

## Making API requests

Now that we've gone over the Link flow and token exchange process, we can explore what happens
when you press a button in the Quickstart to make an API call. As an example, we'll look at the
Quickstart's call to `/summary/sleep`, which retrieves sleep information for a user. The call
is fairly straightforward and uses the `start_date` and `end_date` as arguments to the Vital
client object.

<br />

<CodeBlock title={"Getting User sleep data"}>

```python
from vital import Client

client = Client(api_key=<API_KEY>, environment='sandbox')

sleep_data = client.Sleep.get(start_date, end_date)
```

```js
const { VitalClient } = require("Vital");

const client = new VitalClient({
api_key: <API_KEY>,
environment: "sandbox",
});

const user = await client.User.create(client_user_id)
```

</CodeBlock>

## Next Steps

Congratulations, you have completed the Vital Quickstart! From here, we invite you
to modify the Quickstart code in order to get more practice with the Vital API.

There are a few directions you can go in now:

- [Vital Link](/vital-link/introduction)
- [Vital SDKs](/sdks/ios)
