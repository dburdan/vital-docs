title: "Result Formats"
---

Vital's API returns results in a number of different formats. We currently support:

- `PDF`
- `JSON`
- `HL7`

## PDF Results

We return the raw results in PDF form, that we receive directly from our partner labs. This can be retrieved as follows:

```bash Get order results PDF
curl --request GET \
     --url {{BASE_URL}}/v3/order/result/pdf \
     --header 'Accept: application/json' \
     --header 'Content-Type: application/pdf' \
     --header 'x-vital-api-key: <your_api_key>' \
```

An example result:

<img src="/img/test_result.jpg" className="w-2/3 h-2/3" />

## JSON Results

We also return the parsed results in JSON format, so you can use them to generate your own forms.

These results are returned in a structured format, which you can find [here](/api-reference/results/get-results).

<Warning>The `results` field, according to the spec, can return either a `list[BiomarkerResult]` or an untyped `dict`. This is due to backwards compatibility, and you can disregard the untyped `dict`</Warning>

### Result Status

The `status` field can be one of the following:

1. `ResultStatus.PARTIAL` - The results are partial.
    Labs can return results before all biomarkers are available.
    Vital makes these results available to you as soon as we receive them, but does not send a webhook notification for `partial` results.

    This means that if you probe the API for results, you might get a `partial` result, even if there was no webhook for a `labtest.update` event.

    This is done due to the possibility of [critical values](/lab/workflow/lab-test-lifecycle#critical-results) in the results.

2. `ResultStatus.FINAL` - The results are complete.
    This means that all biomarkers are available, and the results are final. You will receive a `labtest.update` webhook notification for this event.

### BiomarkerResult

A `BiomarkerResult` has the following definition:

```python
name: str
slug: str
value: float  # deprecated
result: str
type: ResultType
unit: str | None
timestamp: datetime | None
notes: str | None
min_range_value: float | None
max_range_value: float | None
is_above_max_range: bool | None
is_below_min_range: bool | None
interpretation: str = Interpretation.NORMAL
```

#### ResultType

Results can fall into one of the following categories:

1. `ResultType.NUMERIC` - A numeric result, e.g. `1.2`

    In this case, the `result` field will be a string representation of the number, and the `value` field will be a float representation of the number.

2. `ResultType.RANGE` - A range result, e.g. `<1.2`

    In this case, the `result` field will be a string representation of the range value, and the `value` field will be `-1`.

    Note that you will also find the `<1.2` value in the `notes` field.

    A range result will always be a value following the pattern `[<>]=?\d+(\.\d+)?`.


3. `ResultType.COMMENT` - A text result, e.g. `Positive`

    In this case, the `result` field will be a string representation of the text, and the `value` field will be `-1`.

    Note that you will also find the `Positive` value in the `notes` field.

<Warning>The `value` field in deprecated and will eventually be removed.</Warning>

#### Interpretation

Interpretation is a string value that can be one of the following:

1. `Interpretation.NORMAL` - The result is within normal parameters.
2. `Interpretation.ABNORMAL` - The result is outside of normal parameters.
3. `Interpretation.CRITICAL` - The result is outside of critical parameters.
    In this case, refer to the [critical values](/lab/workflow/lab-test-lifecycle#critical-results) section.



## HL7 Results

We can also export results to HL7 on request. Please let us know if this is required by contacting support.
