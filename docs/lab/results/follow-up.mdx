Title: "Follow ups"
---

When the test results are ready, you will receive a `labtest.order.updated` webhook where the order has a `complete` status. That means the results are ready and can be [fetched](/lab/results/result-formats).

In case of abnormal results, our physician will determine if a call with the patient is required, and if so, they will follow up to figure out the next steps. Please keep in mind that the follow up call with the patient only happens for orders processed by our physician network. If you provided your own physician when you placed the order, you will be responsible for following up with your patients.
