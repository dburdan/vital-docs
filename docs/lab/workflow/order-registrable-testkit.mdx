title: "Ordering an Registrable Testkit"
---

Under the [standard Testkit ordering flow](/api-reference/lab-testing/create-order), you place a Testkit order for a specific patient. This resulting Testkit is bound to that patient, and the Testkit cannot be passed on to someone else.

With Registrable Testkits, Vital offers a different option â€” Testkits not bound to any specific patient can be ordered to a specific household address. The patient registration process is deferred until an actual patient intends to use the Testkit.

<Warning>
  Note that this only applies to Testkits, not Walk-in Phlebotomy or At-home phlebotomy.
</Warning>

This involves two steps:
  1. Ordering the kit.
  2. Registering a patient.

After step 1, the order is sent to the requested address and generates all the same webhooks as a regular order would. However it is stuck on the `received.testkit.awaiting_registration` state, meaning that no requisition form is generated for this order, and no results can be obtained until step 2 is done.

After step 2, the order flow resumes as normal, the patient sends the `testkit` to the lab, the order is progressed to the `received.testkit.testkit_registered` state and, again, all the same webhooks as in the regular order flow are dispatched.

### Example

To make an order, make a request to our [`POST /v3/order/testkit`](/api-reference/lab-testing/create-unregistered-order), to fulfil step 1.

```python Python
from vital import Client

client = Client(api_key, "sandbox")

data = client.LabTests.create_unregistered_testkit_order(
  user_id="63661a2b-2bb3-4125-bb1a-b590f64f057f",
  lab_test_id="5b41f610-ebc5-4803-8f0c-a61c3bdc7faf",
  shipping_details={
    "receiver_name": "john Doe",
    "street": "123 Main St.",
    "street_number": "Apt. 208",
    "city": "San Francisco",
    "state": "CA",
    "zip": "91189",
    "country": "US",
    "phone_number": "+11234567890"
  }
)
```


The `testkit` is now ordered, and will be sent to the specified address. Once delivered, it can be kept until it's expiration. 

Once the `testkit` is with it's intended patient, it should be registered (step 2).

In order to register, Vital requires a `sample_id`, which is found within the `testkit` itself. This is an unique identifier. 
Vital also requires the patient details and address.
Besides this, if using Vital's physician network, then supplying the consents field is required. If providing your own physician, then the physician information is required.

For this example, we will assume the use of your own physician.

To register a `testkit` order, make a request to our [`POST /v3/order/testkit/register/`](/api-reference/lab-testing/register-order), to fulfil step 2.

```python Python
client = Client(api_key, "sandbox")

data = client.LabTests.register_testkit_order(
  user_id="63661a2b-2bb3-4125-bb1a-b590f64f057f",
  sample_id="123123123",
  patient_details={
    "first_name": "John",
    "last_name": "Doe",
    "dob": "2020-01-01",
    "gender": "male",
    "phone_number": "+1123456789",
    "email": "email@email.com"
  },
  patient_address={
    "receiver_name": "john Doe",
    "street": "123 Main St.",
    "street_number": "Apt. 208",
    "city": "San Francisco",
    "state": "CA",
    "zip": "91189",
    "country": "US"
  },
  physician={
    "first_name": "Doctor",
    "last_name": "Doc",
    "npi": "123123123"
  }
)
```

Your `testkit` order is now registered, and the order flow should resume as normal. For more information regarding the lifecycle of a test, refer to the [lab test lifecyle](/lab/workflow/lab-test-lifecycle) page.
