title: 'Cancelling an Order'
---

Cancelling an order depends how far along in the process the order is in. If an order is early enough in its lifecycle, i.e.:

1. Requisition form is not generated.
2. Order wasn't send.
3. The phlebotomist is not on their way.

It's possible to cancel it by making a request to the [cancel endpoint](/lab/workflow/cancelling-an-order#cancel-endpoint).

<Warning>
When it comes to cancelling an order, to avoid the financial costs associated with late cancelling, we advise the following:

* For test-kits, we recommend cancelling the order before it's shipped. Kits are typically shipped within 24 hours after they are ordered.
* For at-home phlebotomy, appointments can be cancelled without consequence with a notice of at least 24 hours. Cancelling an order with less than 24h notice may incur a financial cost.
</Warning>

### Cancel endpoint

<SnippetGroup>

```bash cURL
curl --request DELETE \
     --url {{BASE_URL}}/v3/lab_test/<order_id>/cancel \
     --header 'Accept: application/json' \
     --header 'x-vital-api-key: <API_KEY>' \
     --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
```

```python Python
from vital import Client

client = Client(
  api_key=<API_KEY>,
  environment="sandbox",
  region="us"
)

data = client.LabTests.cancel_order(order_id='<order_id>');
```

```javascript Node
import { VitalClient, VitalEnvironment } from '@tryvital/vital-node';

const client = new VitalClient({
    apiKey: '<my_api_key>',
    environment: VitalEnvironment.Sandbox,
});

const data = await client.labTests.cancelOrder("<order_id>");
```


```java Java
import com.vital.api.Vital;
import com.vital.api.core.Environment;

Vital vital = Vital.builder()
        .apiKey("YOUR_API_KEY")
        .environment(Environment.SANDBOX)
        .build();

var data = vital.labTests().cancelOrder("<order_id>");
```

```go Go
import (
  "context"

  vital "github.com/tryVital/vital-go"
  vitalclient "github.com/tryVital/vital-go/client"
)

client := vitalclient.NewClient(
  vitalclient.WithApiKey("<YOUR_API_KEY>"),
  vitalclient.WithBaseURL(vital.Environments.Sandbox),
)

response, err := client.LabTests.CancelOrder(context.TODO(), "<order_id>")
if err != nil {
  return err
}
fmt.Printf("Received data %s\n", response)
```

You will receive a response specifying whether the order was successfully cancelled or not.
