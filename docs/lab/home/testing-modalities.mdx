## In lab phlebotomy

In lab draws involve the patient going to a lab location either Quest or Labcorp, to carry out the test.
To carry out this test you need a requisition form. Vital's API can generate this for you, if the patient meets certain conditions. Results are then retrieved via Vital's API.

## At-home phlebotomy

At-home phlebotomy requires mobile phlebotmists visiting a patient at their home and carrying out the phlebotomy draw. The sample is then delivered to the lab by the phlebotomist.
