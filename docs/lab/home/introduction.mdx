Vital's lab test API allows digital health companies to carry out at-home lab testing.
Companies can use the API to order a variety of tests, using various sampling methods.

We partner with CLIA and CAP certified labs across the United States that cover a variety of diagnostic tests. For example lipids panels, metabolic profiles, hormone tests and more.
We collect these test samples via dried bloodspot, saliva or phlebotomy.
