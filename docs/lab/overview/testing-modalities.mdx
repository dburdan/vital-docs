title: "Testing Modalities"
---

By integrating with our API, you will have access to all testing modalities.

Three types are currently supported:

- At-home test kit.
- At-home phlebotomy visit.
- In-lab phlebotomy visit.

## At-home test kits

This involves sending a kit to a patients home that allows the patient to collect their
sample specimen and send back to our lab networks in the mail.

At home testing kits are comprised of a number of components such as:

## At-home phlebotomy

At-home phlebotomy requires mobile phlebotomists visiting a patient at their home and carrying out the phlebotomy draw. The sample is then delivered to the lab by the phlebotomist.

The flow for at-home phlebotomy orders is as follows:

- You [place an order](/lab/overview/quickstart) and we acknowledge your request.
- We start processing the order in the background. For at-home phlebotomy, this means generating the requisition form for the lab test.
- Once the requisition form is ready, we send you a webhook update and we send the patient an email to let them know they can now book an appointment.
- By following the link in the email, the patient goes through our appointment booking dashboard, where they can select a location and time from the available slots.
- Once the appointment takes place and the sample is drawn, it will be taken to the lab.
- Once the lab analyzes the results, the order is complete and you can [fetch the results](/lab/results/result-formats).

## In-lab phlebotomy

In-lab draws involve the patient going to a lab location, either Quest or Labcorp, to carry out the test.
To carry out this test you need a requisition form. Vital's API can generate this for you, if the patient meets certain conditions. Results are then retrieved via Vital's API.

The flow of an in-lab phlebotomy test is very similar to the at-home phlebotomy one. The only difference is that the patient does not book an appointment beforehand, but directly goes to the lab instead.

<Info>
A patient might book an appointment with Labcorp or Quest for in-lab phlebotomy tests, instead of directly going to the lab. We don't support tracking such appointments through our API yet. But we might add this capability in the future!
