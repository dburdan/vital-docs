title: "Order and Follow-up Physician"
---

For an order to be valid/complete, both the request and the results need to be validated by a physician. As such, Vital provides three flows:

## 1. Order and Results through Vital Physician Network

The validation of both the order and the results is done by Vital’s physician network.

For each order, Vital's physician network validates the requisition and, when the results are available, they are uploaded to Vital’s physician network to be evaluated for abnormal/critical results.
On the physician's judgement, the patient may receive a phone call regarding their results.

## 2. Order and Results with Customer Physician Network

In this flow, the Customer must specify a `physician` when making an order request. Both the order and the results are the responsability of the Customer's chosen physician.

## 3. Order with Vital Physician Network and Results with Customer Physician Network

In this flow, the Customer does not specify a `physician` when making an order request - they use Vital’s physician network.

However, the results aren’t uploaded to Vital’s physician network and it's the Customer's physicians responsability to validate the results and do the follow ups.


<Warning>
When there are critical results, Vital’s physician network will always be notified.
