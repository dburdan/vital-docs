# Freestyle

:::note
A user must have a Freestyle Libre account.
:::
import { Flex, Image, Heading } from "@chakra-ui/react";
import { CodeBlock } from "@theme/codeblock";

To connect a user to the Freestyle Libre provider, your user must first connect their
Freestyle Libre account to the vital libre practice. This
allows Vital to start pulling data from their account. This can be done by instructing
your user to the Libre app. Then heading to _Connected Apps_ and clicking on
the _Connect to a practice_ button. From there, they should enter `tryvital` or `tryvital-sandbox`
depending on which environment.

Once your user has connected their Libre account, you can connect your user to Vital
either via the **widget** or the **API**.

## Vital Widget

To connect your user to Vital via the Widget you can follow the guide [here](../../vital-link/launching_link).

## Vital Link

1. To connect to Freestyle Libre, you must create a Vital Link token.

<CodeBlock title={"Connecting email provider"}>

```python

from vital import Client

client = Client(api_key=<API_KEY>, environment='sandbox')

link_token = client.Link.create(user_id)
```

```js
const { VitalClient } = require("Vital");

const client = new VitalClient({
    api_key: <API_KEY>,
    environment: "sandbox",
});

const { link_token } = await client.Link.create(
    userId,
)
```

</CodeBlock>
<br />

2. Libre is an [_email_](../../vital-link/customization#email) provider.
   This means that when connecting a user we have to use
   the connect email provider method, passing in the email of the user's Libre account.
   <br />

<CodeBlock title={"Connecting email provider"}>

```python
client.Link.email_provider(link_token, provider, email)
```

```js
await client.Link.connectEmailProvider(link_token, "freestyle_libre", email);
```

</CodeBlock>

<br />

Once this is complete we will start syncing data from their [Libre account](../../api/data_flow).
