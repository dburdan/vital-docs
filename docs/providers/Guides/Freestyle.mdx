# Freestyle

To connect a user to Freestyle Libre provider:

:::note
A user must have a Freestyle Libre account.
:::
import { Flex, Image, Heading } from "@chakra-ui/react";

Your user must first connect their Freestyle Libre account to the vital libre practice. This
allows Vital to start pulling data from their account. This can be done by instructing
your user to the Libre app. Then heading to _Connected Apps_ and clicking on
the _Connect to a practice_ button. From there, they should enter `tryvital` or `tryvital-sandbox`
depending on which environment.

Once connected, launch a [Vital-Link](../../vital-link/launching_link) for your user to connect their Libre account.

Once this is complete we will start syncing data from their Libre account.
