## Data Frequency

This section describes how we fetch data from the different providers. For all of them, we send you webhook updates when new data is available. The difference is how frequently we fetch data.

Whenever possible, we set up our integrations so that we are immediately notified when new data is available. These are the providers marked as `Webhook` in the table below. For these providers, we fetch the latest data as soon as it is available and we send a webhook update.

For the other providers, marked as `Polling` below, we periodically fetch the latest data every 10-15 minutes. If you want more granular control over this, you can use the [refresh endpoint](/api-reference/user#refresh-users-data) to fetch the latest data immediately.

All data can be fetched instantaneously, some are configured via our live refresh endpoint and others are automatically kept up to date via our webhook implementation.
